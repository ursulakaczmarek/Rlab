###functions are reusable bits of code used to solve a particular problem, like loading a package or calculating an average
syntax: <span style="color:#0e2451">function.name(argument^1^, argument^2^, ...argument^n^)</span>

###they are objects just like data frames, vectors, and lists are objects
you can create them, manipulate them, and rename them just like all other objects

###three parts to a function:
- body (this is the code contained inside the function)
- formals (the arguments the function takes)
- environment (where the function is operating)

## {.build}
### we've already used some functions. remember str_replace() from the stringr package and cbind()?  

###let's examine the body and formals of the str_replace() function
create a new dataset field for borough: parse the borough from the 'court' field  
we want to separate everything before the first bit of whitespace, right?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# syntax: str_replace(string, pattern, replacement)
borough <- str_replace(traffic$court, " .*$", "")
```

###let's break down the pattern argument (inside the first set of quotes):
- R first looks for whitespace ( )
- R then looks for any character (.)
- R then determines if any character appears any number of times (*)
- R then looks until the end of the string ($)

##{.build}
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# syntax: str_replace(string, pattern, replacement)
borough <- str_replace(traffic$court, " .*$", "")
```

###let's break down the replacement argument
- R then replaces the strings that match the pattern with nothing ("")

###let's break down the string argument 
- R applies the pattern and replacement arguments to the character vector we specified: (traffic$court)

###but our replacement doesn't list Staten Island as a borough, it lists Richmond County.
let's also change that using str_replace()

##{.build}
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
borough <- str_replace(borough,"RICHMOND", "STATEN ISLAND")
```

###now let's append our new character vector to our traffic dataset using cbind()
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
traffic <- cbind(traffic, borough, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

##{.build}
###user-defined functions
###many times it will be useful to write your own functions. this can:
- reduce the lines of code you need to complete a task
- reduce repitition in your code (DRY principle)
- reduce opportunities for mistakes

###basic syntax of a user-defined function:
<span style="color:#0e2451">function.name <- </span>function(arg^1^, arg^2^...) {  
  # data manipulation  
  # return value  
}

##{.build}
###data analysis always starts with a question: which borough saw the highest number of people busted for using their mobile while driving?
let's write our own function called 'find.mode' to find the modes in our dataset columns

- include only one argument: the object we're focused on
- remember how we used sort(table(traffic$licensed), decreasing = TRUE) to find the state that appears most?
- we want to return only the first element of that table

###so our function would look like:
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
find.mode <- function(x) {
  sort(table(x), decreasing = TRUE)[1]
}
```

----

###now let's apply the function same as we would a built-in function:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# apply our function to the 'borough' column
find.mode(traffic$borough)
```

###what if we want to find the modes of all the columns in our dataset?
this is where the apply() family of loop functions comes in handy

###also known as functionals, loop functions take other functions as their objects and aid data analysis. each functional will:
- **split** data into smaller pieces
- **apply** a function to each of the smaller pieces
- **combine** the results back however you choose

----

###let's start with lapply()
<span style="color:#0e2451">l</span>apply() splits data into individual observations, applies a function to each observation, and combines them back into a <span style="color:#0e2451">list</span>:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# apply our function to the 'borough' column
lapply(traffic, find.mode)
```

###if the output is a list, that means we use lapply() if our input is going to be of different classes of data like integers and character strings (sounds like a data frame, no?)

###if our data is of the same class, we can simplify our output
<span style="color:#0e2451">s</span>apply() combines our results back into a <span style="color:#0e2451">simple</span> character vector

----
###when creating the borough column, we repeated a lot of stuff with str_replace(), created a whole new vector named 'borough', and had to use cbind() right?  
we could reduce repition by creating a user-defined function and sapply() looping 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
create.borough <- function(traffic, borough, court) {
  traffic['borough'] <- sapply(traffic['court'], 
                               function(court) str_replace_all(court, c(" .*$"="",
                               "RICHMOND"="STATEN ISLAND")))
  return(traffic)
}

traffic <- create.borough(traffic)
```
