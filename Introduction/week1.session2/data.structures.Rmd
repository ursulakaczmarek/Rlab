<h3>a note on expressions</h3>
<p>list of constants (the vectors), names (the labels for our vectors), and calls (everything that happens) behind each computation (action)</p>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# here is a simple operation using the variables x and y
x <- 10
y <- x * 10
is.vector(y)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# get the expression that makes up that operation
exp <- quote(y <- x * 10)
exp # this is the action behind but distinct from the result of 100
# parse the syntax of this expression using ast() from the 'pryr' package
ast(x <- 10)
## the whole group below is the call
#> \- ()
#>  \- `<- # a name
#>  \- `x # a name
#>  \-  10 # a constant 
```

<h3>let's write some quick expressions</h3>
<h4>create a vector with a value of one to 100 and assign it to an object called 'num.range'.</h4>
<p>use a colon to denote the range (start:end)</p>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
num.range <- 1:100
```
<h4>write an expression that uses the mean() function to find the mean value of our num.range object. assign it to an object named 'num.mean'</h4>
<p>our function syntax is mean(object)</p>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
num.mean <- mean(num.range)
```

<h4>print out num.mean</h4>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
num.mean
```

##{.build}
<h4>create a character vector that reads "this is a string" and assign it to an object called 'string'</h4>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
string <- "this is a string"
```

<h4>write an expression that uses the gsub() function to replace the letter 's' in our vector with a '$' and assign our new string to an object called 'string.sub'</h4>
<p>look up the gsub() syntax</p>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
?gsub
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
string.sub <- gsub("s", "$", string)
```

<h3>pro tips on naming variables</h3>
>- <p>don't use existing function names like sum, mean, parse, etc.    
want to find out if your object is a function? use <span style="color:#0e2451">is.function()</span>
>- <p>don't use logic type vectors (TRUE or FALSE or NA or T or F)</p>
>- <p>don't begin them with numbers (R will paste an 'x' before column headers starting with numbers)</p>
>- <p>remember R replaces original objects when their assigned variables take on new assignments. look at the global environment pane to see the active values and datasets.</p>
>- <p>give them some referential meaning</p>

<h3>the class attribute and factors</h3>
<h4>every object has attributes, the most important are type, name, dimension, and class</h4>
<h4>common classes: character, integer, list, data.frame...</h4>
<p>in general, an object's class determines its behavior (e.g., how it responds to a function) and is different from an object's type, which relates to how it's stored in memory</p>
<h4>factors are a class of vectors that have predefined values to store categorical data</h4> 
<p>you can't pass numeric functions through factors even if the vector is a number</p>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
x <- as.factor(1:10)
# these will throw an error
mean(x)
x[3] <- 3.5
```

----
<h3>why do we need factors?</h3>
>- <h4>factors are useful when you've got an idea of the possible values in your dataset and want to categorize them (very useful when colorizing in visualizations)</h4>
>- <h4>factors are essential when training models with variables labelled as numbers (ZIP codes, diabetes types, program codes, user IDs, etc.) and want to treat them as labels, not numeric values
>- <h4> when reading in data, sometimes number columns load as a factor. You've got some non-numeric characters in there somewhere and R automatically converts strings to a factor</h4>
  <p>we can suppress this behavior using the argument stringsAsFactors = FALSE</p>

----
<h3>next up: multi-dimensional data structures</h3>
>- <h4>matrices and arrays: same vector class</h4>
    <p>a matrix is just a 2D array</p>
>- <h4>matrices are useful if you want to store your data in a grid. we won't have much use for them at first</h4>
    <p>most of the data we'll see is made up of different classes and must be stored in a data frame</p>
>- <h4>data frames are simply equal-length lists (typeof() will produce "list")</h4>
>- <h4>it's useful to know the basics of these multidimensional structures when we start passing functions through our data</h4>

----
<h3>let's look at dimensions</h3>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
x <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 2, nrow = 5)
x
```
<p>note the numbers in the square brackets</p>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
shows <- data.frame(character = c("Kirk", "Picard", "Janeway"),
                    show = c("Star Trek", "TNG", "Voyager"),
                    show.order = c(1,2,3), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(shows)
colnames(shows) <- c("captains", "show", "show.order")
colnames(shows)[colnames(shows) == 'show'] <- 'show.name' #or
colnames(shows)[2] <- 'show.name'
```

<h2>let's load our first data frame</h2>
>- <h3>traffic.csv is a dataset I downloaded from data.ny.gov</h3>
<p>i've put in the Rlab repo the script used to download and clean the dataset(mobile.violations.R)</p>
>- <h3>let's load the dataset using the read.csv function and call it 'traffic'
<p>let's include the option of not changing our string data type to factors</p>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
traffic <- read.csv("traffic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

>- <h3>let's get some quick and dirty info about our dataset</h3> 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
str(traffic)
summary(traffic)
colnames(traffic)
```
