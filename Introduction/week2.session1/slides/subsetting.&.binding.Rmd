##picking apart your data  
###subsetting is useful when you want to separate your data based on certain values,when you want to remove NAs or unknowns, etc.
we're going to create several different data frames now, so let's save our code to a script to easily recreate these in the future

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# let's load our traffic ticket data and call it 'traffic'
traffic <- read.csv("traffic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# get an overview of the data
str(traffic)
``` 

###let's look at the states represented in the dataset

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# print out all states 
table(traffic$licensed)
# we can also sort them in ascending order
sort(table(traffic$licensed))
# or descending
sort(table(traffic$licensed), decreasing = TRUE)
# two variables in the contintency table (like a pivot table) 
table(traffic$licensed, traffic$gender)
``` 

## {.build}
###hey, what's that <span style="color:#ed2354">$</span> doing there?
a subsetting operator that IDs a single column name in our data frame
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# print out the seventh column in our dataset using the column name
traffic$weekday
```

###focus on a single column using its position in double square brackets
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# this will print out the same thing but R simplifies it to a character vector
traffic[[7]]

## single brackets to keep as a data frame 
traffic.weekday <- traffic[7]
```

###we can subset single rows too
R subsets multidimnesional objects with a [row, column] index
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# leaving the column index blank returns all columns
traffic[1, ]
```

----

###what's up with the single brackets?
each row has more than one value, and we use single brackets for subsetting multiple values

###subsetting more than one row or column
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# subset more than one column
traffic[c("court", "weekday")] # or
traffic[c(1,7)]

# subset the first ten rows on the data 
traffic[1:10, ]

# subset rows 10 and 15
traffic[c(10, 15), ]
```

----

###say we want to create a new dataset called 'bronx' that contains only tickets issued in the Bronx
that sounds like subsetting our observations!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# what is the Bronx court called?
table(traffic$court) 
``` 

###we know what column we want, so how do we pick out the rows?
logical subsetting: R picks out rows based on a matching condition    
(like 'WHERE' in SQL)  

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
# note the indexing and the double equal sign!
## we're not assigning values, so we use a double equal sign operator
bronx <- traffic[traffic$court == "BRONX TVB", ]
``` 

##{.build}
###let's create a dataset called 'manhattan' for both Manhattan courts
ID rows with either Manhattan North TVB or Manhattan South TVB  
the or operator is the pipe: '|'   (SHIFT + \\\)
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
manhattan <- traffic[traffic$court == "MANHATTAN NORTH TVB" | 
                    traffic$court == "MANHATTAN SOUTH TVB", ]
``` 

we can also use 'in' just like in SQL
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
manhattan <- traffic[traffic$court %in% 
                    c("MANHATTAN NORTH TVB", "MANHATTAN SOUTH TVB"), ]
``` 

###let's try it for tickets issued in Queens. call the dataset 'queens'
the courts are <span style="color:#0e2451">"QUEENS NORTH TVB" & "QUEENS SOUTH TVB"</span>

##{.build}
##the subset() function
an alternative to index-based subsetting that is more convenient but can produce unintended results in larger datasets

###let's create a dataset called 'brooklyn.north' using the subset() function

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
brooklyn.north <- subset(traffic, court == "BROOKLYN NORTH TVB")
``` 
###create another called brooklyn.south
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
brooklyn.south <- subset(traffic, court == "BROOKLYN SOUTH TVB")
``` 

##{.build}
##the rbind() and cbind() functions

###join north and south rows into a single dataset using rbind() 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
brooklyn <- rbind(brooklyn.north, brooklyn.south, make.row.names = FALSE)
``` 

###create a unique ID for each row in brooklyn and add it using cbind()
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, prompt = TRUE}
unique.id <- 1:nrow(brooklyn)
brooklyn <- cbind(unique.id, brooklyn)
```
